Utilities and notebooks for Andrej Karapthy's makemore

This is a fork of Andrej Karapathy's makemore (https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) which I have recoded for my own understanding. It follows the original closely but some functions are tweaked so that logic makes sense to me. Sometimes I felt there were sweetners available in pytorch and I have tried to use them liberally.

Rather than have everything in one file I have moved all the utility functions to the utils file so that the notebooks can be mostly about understanding the network architecture.

# makemore-utils-nbs
Utilities and notebooks for Andrej Karapthy's makemore

A fork of Andrej Karapathy's makemore (https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) recoded and tweaked for my understanding. Follows the original closely in logic but functions might look different in detail since I have reconstructed them (might also be less/more optimal based on usage of Pytorch sweetners). Utility functions have been refactored into a separate file so the nbs can focus on the network architecture.

Utilities and notebooks for Andrej Karapthy's makemore

A fork of Andrej Karapathy's makemore (https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) recoded and tweaked for my understanding. Follows the original closely in logic but with tweaked functions when I wanted to use sweetners available in Pytorch. Also refactored to have utility functions in a separate file so the nbs can be used to understand the network architecture.
